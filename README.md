## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MySQL installed and running on your system

### Installing Dependencies
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-user-management.git
   cd flask-user-management
   ```

2. Install Flask and MySQL Connector:
   ```
   pip install Flask mysql-connector-python
   ```

### Database Setup
1. Create a MySQL database named "users" with the appropriate user credentials.

2. Create a table named "users" in the "users" database with the following columns:
   - id (int, primary key)
   - name (varchar)
   - email (varchar)
   - role (varchar)

## Running the Application
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.

2. Start the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. The application will be running at http://localhost:5004/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

## Database Schema

The "users" table in the "users" database should have the following schema:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    role VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Populating Sample Data

To insert sample data into the "users" table, use SQL queries. For example:

```
INSERT INTO users (name, email, role) VALUES
('John Doe', 'john@example.com', 'Admin'),
('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', 'User');
```
